Programming language: Python

The purpose of this project was to extract data from a web site into another stored format: in this case csv. The web site scraped 
was Lund Universities admissions page and all degree programs were extracted into a csv file with the written code.
BeautifulSoup was used to extract the data from the universities website. The final csv file is also available as
