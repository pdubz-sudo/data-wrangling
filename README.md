# data-wrangling
scraping data from Lund University web page

Programming language: Python

The purpose of this project was to extract data from a web site into another stored format: in this case csv. The web site scraped 
was Lund Universities admissions page, http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/programs, and running the code extracts all degree
programs into a csv file. BeautifulSoup was used to extract the data from the universities website.
