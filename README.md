# data-wrangling | web scraping and cleaning data
scraping and cleaning data from Lund University web page

Programming language: Python

The purpose of this project was to extract and clean data from a web site into another stored format: in this case csv. The web site 
scraped was Lund Universities admissions page, http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/programs, and running the code extracts all degree
programs into a csv file. The education level of each program is then cleaned and categorized. BeautifulSoup was used to extract the data 
from the universities website.

Files in repository:
- code
- image of the websit
- csv output file

*Note: The code was run on December 11, 2017. If it does not work then the website has changed the format of their code.
